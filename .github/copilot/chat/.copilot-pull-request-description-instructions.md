## Title Rules

- Use a **single, general title** that summarizes the whole commit.
- Capitalize the first letter.
- Do **not** end with a period.
- Keep it short and descriptive.
- Describe the **primary intent**, not implementation details.
- Prefer the pattern:\
  `<Action> <Primary Area>`

Examples: - `Application Code Update` -
`Improve JWT Authorization Handling` -
`Add Redis Caching and API Stability Fixes`

---

## Spacing

- Always leave **one empty line** after the title.
- Do not add blank lines inside bullet lists.

---

## Sections

- Use these sections when applicable:
  - `Features`
  - `Bug Fixes`
- Omit any section that has no entries.
- Keep sections ordered with the most impactful changes first.

---

## Bullet Rules

- Use `*` for each item.
- Format:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

    * <Change Name>: <Very brief description>

- Start with a **present-tense verb**: Add, Update, Improve, Refactor,
  Fix, Remove, Optimize.
- Keep bullets concise and scannable.
- Prefer one line per bullet.
- Do not repeat the title inside bullets.

---

## Priority

- Place **critical changes at the top** of each section.
- Mark critical items explicitly when useful:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```

    * [CRITICAL] Cache layer: Prevent repeated database hits under heavy load.

---

## Style Guidelines

- Use **present tense** and **active voice**.
- Be concise but informative.
- Focus on **behavior and impact**, not low-level implementation
  noise.
- Avoid vague wording like:
  - "minor change"
  - "small fix"
  - "misc updates"
- Ensure consistency across all commits.

---

## Ordering

1. Title\
2. Blank line\
3. Features (if any)\
4. Bug Fixes (if any)
