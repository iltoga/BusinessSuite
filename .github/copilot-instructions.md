# AI Coding Assistant Instructions for RevisBaliCRM

## Project Overview

RevisBaliCRM is a Django-based ERP/CRM system for service agencies, managing customer applications with document workflows, invoicing, and payments. Key components include customer applications, document processing with OCR, task-based workflows, and REST API integration.

## Architecture

- **Apps**: `customers`, `products`, `customer_applications`, `invoices`, `payments`, `core`
- **Data Flow**: Products define tasks/workflows and document types → CustomerApplications link customers to products → Documents collected per application → Workflows track task progress → Invoices generated from completed applications
- **Key Models**:
  - `DocApplication`: Core application entity with status tracking
  - `Document`: File/number/expiration/details with completion logic based on `DocumentType` requirements
  - `DocWorkflow`: Task progress with due dates and notifications
  - `Product`: Defines tasks and required document types
- **UI**: Django templates + Bootstrap + Django Unicorn for reactive components (e.g., dynamic form updates without full page reloads)

## Critical Workflows

- **Setup**: Run `./start.sh` for migrations, data population, user creation, static collection
- **Data Population**: Use `fixtures.sh` or management commands like `populate_documenttypes`, `populate_products`
- **Reset**: `./reset_app.sh` clears DB and migrations for clean slate
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose with Postgres, pgAdmin, memcached, cron jobs
- **Backups**: Automated to Dropbox via `django-dbbackup`
- **OCR Processing**: Uses `pytesseract` and `passporteye` for passport scans, stores metadata in `Document.metadata` JSONField

## Project Conventions

- **APIs**: Django REST Framework (DRF) with APIView classes for endpoints; token authentication via `rest_framework.authtoken`; serializers in `api/serializers/`
- **Views**: Django generic class-based views (ListView, CreateView, etc.) with templates; Bootstrap 5 for styling; Django Unicorn for reactive components (AJAX updates via `unicorn:click`, `unicorn:model`)
- **Forms**: Django ModelForm and inlineformset_factory for formsets; rendered with Crispy Forms (`{% load crispy_forms_tags %}`, `{{ form | crispy }}`); Widget Tweaks for field customization; Nested Admin for inline forms in admin
- **Document Completion**: In `Document.save()`, check fields based on `DocumentType` flags (e.g., `has_file`, `has_expiration_date`)
- **Upload Paths**: `documents/<customer_folder>/<application_id>/<filename>` via `get_upload_to()` function
- **Workflow Progression**: Applications advance via `DocWorkflow` completion; due dates calculated with business day logic
- **Search Managers**: Custom managers like `DocApplicationManager.search_doc_applications()` for query filtering
- **Signals**: Post-delete cleanup for application folders using `shutil.rmtree()`
- **Environment**: Use `.env` for secrets; settings split into `base.py`, `dev.py`, `prod.py`
- **API**: DRF with token auth; endpoints for customers, products, OCR checks
- **Cron Jobs**: Disabled Django cron due to Django 5 compatibility; use custom scripts

## Examples

- **Creating a Document**: Ensure `completed` field updates based on `doc_type.has_file` etc. in `save()` method
- **Workflow Due Dates**: Use `calculate_due_date()` from `core.utils.dateutils` for business day calculations
- **Model Deletion**: Override `delete()` to check relations (e.g., prevent deleting invoiced applications)
- **File Handling**: Use `default_storage` for cloud/local storage abstraction
- **Unicorn Components**: Place in app `components/` folders for reactive UI elements

## Integration Points

- **Dropbox**: File storage and backups via `django-storages`
- **OCR**: `passporteye` for MRZ reading; metadata extraction stored as JSON
- **Payments**: Custom payment processing (check `payments` app)
- **External APIs**: REST endpoints for third-party integrations

Focus on maintaining data integrity, especially around document completion and workflow states. Use existing patterns for new features to ensure consistency.
