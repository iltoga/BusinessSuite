## 🦄 Why Django Unicorn?

Django Unicorn is a reactive component framework for Django that allows you to build modern, interactive web applications without leaving the Django ecosystem. We chose Django Unicorn for several reasons:

- **Seamless Integration**: Unicorn is tightly integrated with Django and feels like a natural extension of the core Django experience.
- **Reactive UI**: It enables highly-interactive user interfaces by making AJAX calls in the background and dynamically updating the HTML DOM, similar to frameworks like Vue or React, but with pure Django templates.
- **Simplicity**: Unicorn installs just like any other Django package and is easy to implement. You only need to add a few magic attributes to your Django HTML templates to get started.
- **No JavaScript Required**: You can build interactive components without writing custom JavaScript, reducing complexity and keeping your codebase clean.
- **Modern UX**: It brings the power of reactive components to Django, allowing for a smoother and more engaging user experience.

By using Django Unicorn, our application benefits from a modern, dynamic frontend while maintaining the simplicity and robustness of Django. This choice helps us deliver a better experience to users and developers alike. ✨
