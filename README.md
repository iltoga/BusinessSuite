# RevisBaliCRM
CRM for RevisBali

## Ideas

### Telegram bot
[tgbot on github](https://github.com/Ali-Toosi/django-tgbot)

A bot to get (and possibly insert) data from/to the CRM.

### Parse uploaded documents

Scan documents for MRZ (machine readable zones) and extract info such as name, number, expiration date.

[PassportEye](https://pypi.org/project/PassportEye/)
The package provides tools for recognizing machine readable zones (MRZ) from scanned identification documents. The documents may be located rather arbitrarily on the page - the code tries to find anything resembling a MRZ and parse it from there.
