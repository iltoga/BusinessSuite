### Key Components

**Views**: All views use Django's `TemplateView` with `LoginRequiredMixin` for authentication. Data is aggregated using Django ORM with annotations, aggregations, and complex queries.

**Template Tags**: Custom `to_json` filter for safely serializing Python data to JSON for Chart.js.

**Utilities**:
- `date_utils.py`: Date range filtering and month list generation
- `report_helpers.py`: Currency formatting and trend indicators

**Charts**: Uses Chart.js 4.4.0 for interactive, responsive charts (line, bar, pie, doughnut).

**Print Support**: All reports include print-optimized CSS for professional PDF generation via browser print function.

## Usage

### Accessing Reports

1. Navigate to `/reports/` to see the reports index page
2. Click on any report card to view the specific report
3. Use the navigation menu (sidebar or top navbar) to access reports directly

### Navigation Menu

Reports are accessible from:
- **Top Navbar**: Dropdown menu with all reports
- **Sidebar**: Collapsible "Reports" section with all reports
- **Reports Index**: Card-based layout grouped by category

### Filtering

Reports that support filtering (Revenue, Cash Flow):
1. Use the date picker inputs to select date range
2. Click "Filter" button to apply filters
3. Click "Reset" to return to default view (current year)

### Printing

1. Click the "Print Report" button on any report
2. Use browser's print dialog to:
   - Save as PDF
   - Print to physical printer
   - Adjust page settings

The print stylesheet automatically:
- Hides navigation elements
- Optimizes chart sizes
- Ensures proper page breaks

## Permissions

All reports require authentication (`LoginRequiredMixin`). Future enhancement could add granular permissions per report type.

## Performance Considerations

- Complex aggregation queries may be slow with large datasets
- Consider adding database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Cache report data for frequently accessed reports
- Use pagination for large result sets in tables

## Future Enhancements

1. **Export Options**: CSV, Excel, PDF downloads
2. **Email Reports**: Scheduled email delivery
3. **Custom Date Ranges**: Presets (last week, last quarter, etc.)
4. **Report Scheduling**: Automated report generation
5. **Data Caching**: Redis caching for expensive queries
6. **Comparison Views**: Side-by-side period comparisons
7. **Drill-down**: Click charts to view detailed data
8. **Permissions**: Role-based report access control
9. **Favorites**: Save frequently used report configurations
10. **Annotations**: Add notes and comments to reports

## Maintenance

### Adding New Reports

1. Create a new view class in `reports/views/`
2. Add URL pattern in `reports/urls.py`
3. Create template in `reports/templates/reports/`
4. Update navigation menus in `base_template.html`
5. Add report card to `reports_index_view.py`

### Modifying Existing Reports

1. Update view logic in respective view file
2. Modify template for UI changes
3. Update chart configurations as needed
4. Test with various data scenarios

## Troubleshooting

**Charts not displaying**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors. Ensure Chart.js is loading correctly.

**No data showing**: Verify database has records. Check date range filters.

**Slow performance**: Add database indexes. Consider caching. Optimize queries.

**Print layout issues**: Adjust CSS in `base_report.html` print media queries.
